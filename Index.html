            When creating a website from the ground up at CART you need to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; however, before even getting started, there is a free use software program called Visual Studio Code. This program allows any user to create a website using programming languages. Photoshop is useful when creating a website because when adding images to the site, the creator needs to take load time into consideration as most of the load time will be because of images. To fix the problem of long loading images, one wants to compress the image to a smaller size since the image is not likely to take up most of the screen. <br><br>
            One concept I learned from my time creating websites, would probably be to make sure to never forget the little things, when using a language like JavaScript every comma is important, every period is important. If a single thing is missing from the code, most of the time the entire code will refuse to work. JavaScript is also very important for a website as it will change the website without changing the url, meaning you wouldn't have to load the next page or spend time waiting for an   image to change. <br><br>
             When creating a website, overall there are Habits of Mind that need to be used throughout the entire process. Initiate with the website as you should think about what you might want to make before the code may begin. Investigate the code to make sure that you may not be repeating yourself as that is a core point for web development. Persist through the challenges and reflect on what might possibly be causing problems. Often when reflecting on problems solutions may arise from past challenges making the solution all the better.</div></div></p>
